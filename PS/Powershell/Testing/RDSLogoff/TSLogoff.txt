TSLogoff V3 is a command-line tool to logoff Citrix or Terminal Server
Sessions from a particular server within a Domain. 

This utility was written to replace the command LOGOFF.EXE currently
found in the MS Windows Operating System. This utility offers an extra
feature that will be of benefit to all admins - the * (ALL) switch.
Using this switch, an admin can logoff all users on a Citrix/TS server
with one command. This command can also be used in a script.

This utility is FREEWARE and was written by Warren Simondson of
Ctrl-Alt-Del IT Consultancy, Australia. www.ctrl-alt-del.com.au
